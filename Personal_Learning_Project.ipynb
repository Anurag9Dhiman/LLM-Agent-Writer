        "\n",
        "In the context of LangChain tools, the `name`, `func` (or `_run`/_arun`), and `description` attributes are crucial for how the agent interacts with and utilizes the tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`name`**:\n",
        "    *   **Role and Importance:** The `name` attribute provides a unique identifier for the tool. When an agent needs to use a tool to accomplish a task, it refers to the tool by its `name`. The LLM in the agent's reasoning process will output the `name` of the tool it decides to use.\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** It acts as the command or action word that the agent uses to invoke the tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **`func` (or `_run`/`_arun` methods)**:\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** This attribute (or the methods `_run` for synchronous execution and `_arun` for asynchronous execution in a `BaseTool` subclass) defines the actual logic or functionality that the tool performs. When the agent calls the tool by its `name`, the code specified in `func`, `_run`, or `_arun` is executed.\n",
        "    *   **In `BaseTool` Subclasses:** Instead of a single `func` attribute, `BaseTool` subclasses implement the `_run` and `_arun` methods to define the tool's behavior. The agent calls these methods with the necessary input.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **`description`**:\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** The `description` attribute provides a natural language explanation of what the tool does, its purpose, and often, the expected input format.\n",
        "    *   **Agent Usage:** LangChain agents, especially those based on the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework, use the `description` to understand the capabilities of each available tool. The LLM processes the task and the descriptions of the tools to decide which tool is most relevant and how to use it. A clear and informative description is essential for the agent to make correct decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Contribution to Agent's Ability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these attributes enable the agent to effectively select and use tools:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The **`description`** allows the agent (specifically the LLM) to understand what tools are available and which one is appropriate for the current step of the task.\n",
        "*   The **`name`** provides the specific identifier that the agent uses to call the chosen tool.\n",
        "*   The **`func`** (or `_run`/_arun`) is the executable code that performs the actual work of the tool, taking the agent's input and producing an output.\n",
        "\n",
        "This combination of descriptive information and executable functionality is fundamental to building intelligent agents that can interact with their environment through tools."

The most reliable way to fix this is to explicitly create (or re-create) the `tools/base_tool.py` file with the `BaseAgent` definition and then re-define the `ResearchAgent` to ensure it can import `BaseAgent`. I will also include the definitions of `SearchTool` and `WriteFileTool` again in the same code block to ensure all necessary components are defined and available.\n",

The next step is to integrate this wrapper into the existing agents so they can utilize these different prompting styles. This involves modifying the agent classes (`PlanningAgent`, `ResearchAgent`, `ContentAgent`, and `ReviewAgent`) to accept an instance of `LLMWrapper` and use its methods for generating content. I will modify all agent classes in a single code block to ensure they can use the LLMWrapper and then write the updated class definitions to their respective files (or simulate this by redefining them in the current environment). I will also include the necessary imports for the agents and the LLMWrapper.\n",

Subsequently, methods for `generate_with_cot`, `generate_with_few_shot`, and `generate_with_self_consistency` were added to the `LLMWrapper`. Finally, the existing agent classes (`PlanningAgent`, `ResearchAgent`, `ContentAgent`, and `ReviewAgent`) were modified to accept an instance of the `LLMWrapper` and utilize its methods for generating responses. The different prompting styles were then tested with sample tasks, and their outputs were manually evaluated to assess their impact.\n",
